        <h2>A Special Message</h2>
        <p> Everything good happened from the very first time you stepped into my life, when ever I think about you, I know you changed my life, I might not be doing it right now but with you I'm royalty, you thought me that.
        </p>
        <p>You thought me how to be strong, you thought me how to be me, you thought me how to be a bad guy, I am a bad guy because I'm not giving up on us no matter what challenges we might be facing now, I love you and there is nothing anyone can do about it.
        </p>
        <p>Your smile imprisons me for real, I feel it all over my mind, all over my dream. I love the fact that you are up and doing, you are always cool, you are sweet, you are like that first morning sun that brightens up my window.</p>
        <p>Right now with you in my life, I am already living my dreams, I'm living my best life, I'm happy I'm with you. You came into my life and gave me a  plan, I was almost useless before I met you but here I am trying to code like I'm Codablack.</p>
        <p>The question I've always asked myself is how did I get here? Where have you been all my life? Who really are you because it seems you're in my head, you seem to know everything I think about and it's just a miracle cause nobody seem to get me.</p>
        <p>I can go on and on about how sweet and how beautiful your soul is because I love when I think about all of this goodness, I didn't know I will be so lucky and God bless your mum.</p>
        <p>You're a Queen for real, a first hand goddess and a blend of Awesomeness. A lady of style, poise, prestige, ego and charm.I love you</p>
